# Contact

A contacts app. ðŸ“±

## Description

An essential application to manage your contacts efficiently in a clean and simple interface. With full create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) capabilities, as well as an instant call option using built-in Intents.
Easily organize your contacts and quickly access them when you need them.

**The app contains three screens:**
- **The main screen:** the entry point of the app and the place where all saved contacts will be displayed, has a search engine and a button to create a new contact. In turn, when a contact is selected, a dialog will appear with its information and the possibility of calling, editing or deleting the item.
- **The new contact screen:** pressing the floating button will open a screen with basic information to save the contact data. This is incomplete since more text fields are missing to take advantage of the space.
- **The third screen:** a screen similar to the addition screen will open, this will show the contact data thanks to the sending of data through navigation.

***Supports light/dark themes and has support for dynamic colors for Android versions +12 and up.***

## Architecture
The type of architecture used for this project was MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel).

This is divided into the:

- Model: Which represents the data and business logic.
- View: Which represents the UI.
- ViewModel: Which represents the bridge between the View and the Model.

**This contains only two layers:**
- **The data layer:** Which contains the repositories and the database.
- **The presentation layer:** which contains all the UI components that will be rendered on the screen. It also has a ViewModel that works as a state container and contains business logic.
